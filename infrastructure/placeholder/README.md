# Placeholder
The placeholder is used to fake or mock out service, file system or other calls.
It's purpose is to provide a way to start up an application (such as AOL) and fake the endpoints of services (such as AIS).
This enables us a way to bring the application up without having to have all the backend services running.

### To install AIS Placeholder
follow the [AIS install instructions](ais/README.md)
